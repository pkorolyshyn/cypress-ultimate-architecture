# Tags like @CAL-101 or @CAL-102 are used to connect this scenario with its metadata
# defined in `support/allureMeta.hooks.js`. Thatâ€™s where we assign Allure labels like feature,
# story, severity, and ticket info. The tag here triggers the matching `Before` hook.
#
# You can add more tags (like @smoke or @calendar) for filtering tests with Cypress grep,
# but only tags used in hooks will map to Allure metadata.
