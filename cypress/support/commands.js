// In this framework, we use the Page Object Model (POM) combined with reusable wrapper classes (e.g., SingleElement, InputElement)
// to handle interactions and assertions. This provides structure, readability, and scalability for large test suites.
//
// Cypress also supports defining global custom commands in this file using `Cypress.Commands.add(...)`.
// That approach is a good alternative if you prefer not to use Page Objects or wrapper classes,
// and want to write test logic in a more functional, Cypress-native style.
//
// However, this project is built around the POM approach as an educational and professional example
// of how to build a scalable Cypress framework using that specific architecture.
