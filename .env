# ⚠️ DO NOT commit real passwords or secrets to Git
# This is only an example for local development
# Add this file to .gitignore
#
# These example environment variables are used by Cypress config files
# (e.g., cypress.env1.ts, cypress.env2.ts) to simulate environment-specific login credentials.
# They are loaded automatically using the `dotenv` package.
#
# When Cypress runs locally, these values are injected using `process.env` in the config files.
# In CI environments, use GitHub/GitLab secrets instead.
