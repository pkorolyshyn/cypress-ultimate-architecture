# 🧹 Pre-commit Git hook
# This hook runs automatically before each commit.
# It uses `lint-staged` to:
#   - Run ESLint with --fix on staged TypeScript files
#   - Run Prettier to format staged files
#
# ✅ Only staged files are checked — this keeps commits fast.
# ❌ It does NOT run full lint or format on the entire project.
#
# Configuration for lint-staged is defined in package.json under the "lint-staged" field.
# If any command fails (linting or formatting), the commit will be blocked.

npx lint-staged
